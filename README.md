okay, so basically i got sent this instagram reel [https://www.instagram.com/p/DCYIYeeA1EP/] and its been stuck in my head, so i thought i would try and figure out how it works and write my own version.

don't judge the code to harshly i did it in ab evening and did not comment cause i dont plan on working on it further and all the code is very self explanitory.

[space] spawns a brush that will bounce around and leave a trail of paint.
